# PRONY

Folder contains very basic files for prony method for signal analysis. Input signal is a synthetically generated signal ( first part of which is an exponentially decaying sinusoidal function impeded on another sine function and second part of which is an exponentially decaying sinusoidal function )

Window wise analysis is done to view any change in the pattern of Numerator or denominator values obtained from prony dure to change is frequency of the synthetic signal.
